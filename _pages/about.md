I am a PhD Candidate at [The Fletcher School of Tufts University](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/) and a Research Fellow at the [Climate Policy Lab](https://www.climatepolicylab.org/). My dissertation research examines how the political and economic interests around fossil fuels came to be, why they persist, and what dynamics reinforce them over time. Prior to joining the doctoral program, I received my master's degree in economics from Boston University and a bachelor's degree in business analytics and economics from the George Washington University. My scholarly work has appeared in the *Environmental Research Letters*, *Climate Policy*, *The Conversation*, and elsewhere.
